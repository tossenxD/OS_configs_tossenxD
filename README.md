# Notable configurations
**Color themes:** Color themes are located in the directory [.colors/](https://github.com/tossenxD/dotfiles/blob/main/.colors/). Color themes is declared in [.Xresources](https://github.com/tossenxD/dotfiles/blob/main/.Xresources) and is used systemwide after declaration. A script to change color theme is aliased to "systheme". Calling this command in a terminal will allow you to choose a theme and it will automaticly be declared in .Xresources and refresh.

**Shortcuts:** Multiple alias are defined in the .bashrc, some based on scripts from scripts/. WM keybinds are defined in .config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc. On first NeoVim launch pluggins will be installed. These pluggins include shortcuts and snippets in NeoVim. View [.config/nvim/](https://github.com/tossenxD/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/)) for further information on how NeoVim binds and pluggins are setup.

**Other:** Keyboard-layout can be set in .xinitrc. Configurations are in the different dotfiles. Polybar multi-monitor support can be outcommented in .config/polybar/launch.sh.
